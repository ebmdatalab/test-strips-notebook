# ## Blood Gluse Test Strips Price Information

# A user has gotten in touch as they require price information on blood glucose test strips for analysis they want to carry out. Our [OpenPrescribing drug tariff browser/viewer](https://openprescribing.net/tariff/) currently only support part 8 whereas test strips are located in the device section. [Prescribing patterns of blood glucose test strips](https://openprescribing.net/chemical/0601060D0/) can be viewed on OpenPrescribing.
#
# However on our price per unit tool we do incoproarte blood glucose test strips so we do have the price paid (accepted slightly different to drug tariff) in our database. The [PPU for blood glucose test strips and possible savings can be seen here](https://openprescribing.net/national/england/0601060D0AAA0A0/price-per-unit/?date=2020-05-01).
#
# In this notebook we will extract the median price paid for the user and export to csv for their own (and others) analysis.
